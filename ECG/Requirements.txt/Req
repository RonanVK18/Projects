This directory diretly consists of an inference script as well as a sample dataset(columns not copied).

The preloaded model has been saved as as a ".h5" file and can be preloaded using the latest tensorflow version v2.16.1  using load_model

The Data does not need preprocessing only reshaped to fit the model accurately, that part has been conducted by the "function" in the inference script splits the data into 2 parts X & Y,
allowing us to categorically predict the value of the last column.

Once the categorical value has been predicted it is then compared aagainst an existing dictionary of labels that we have understood from the DATASET.
